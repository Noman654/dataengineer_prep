# **The Data Engineer Prep Guide**  

Welcome to **The Data Engineer Prep Guide**, A repository dedicated to helping data engineers prepare for interviews and hone their skills. My goal is to make preparation simple, structured, and collaborative.  

## **Current Focus: Spark**  
Weâ€™re starting with Spark, one of the most essential tools in a data engineerâ€™s toolkit. The repository currently includes practical examples and commonly asked syntax questions to help you revise effectively.  

### **Repository Structure**  
```
ðŸ“‚ Spark/  
   â””â”€â”€ syntax_practical/  
       â””â”€â”€ common_asked_syntax.ipynb  
ðŸ“„ README.md  
```  

### **Contents**  
- **Spark Syntax Practical:**  
  - A notebook (`common_asked_syntax.ipynb`) covering frequently used Spark commands and operations.  
  - Designed for quick revision and hands-on practice.  

## **Planned Expansion**  
This repository is a work in progress! Future sections will include:  
- **Kafka**: Real-time data streaming concepts and hands-on examples.  
- **DBT**: Data transformations in modern pipelines.  
- **SQL**: Practice queries and optimization tips.  
- **Data Lake**: Best practices for data storage and retrieval.  

## **Getting Started**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-engineer-prep-guide.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the `Spark` folder to start with the provided notebook.  
3. Open the notebook with Jupyter or any compatible tool to explore the syntax examples OR you can directly run notebook using google-collab.

## **Contributing**  
We welcome contributions to make this guide comprehensive and beginner-friendly. Hereâ€™s how you can help:  
1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a branch for your updates.  
3. Submit a pull request with your contributions.  

### **What You Can Contribute**  
- Add syntax examples or commonly asked questions for Spark.  
- Improve the existing content for clarity or accuracy.  
- Share practical examples for upcoming topics (Kafka, DBT, SQL, etc.).  

## **Letâ€™s Build Together**  
This repository is for the community, by the community. Whether youâ€™re preparing for interviews or sharing your expertise, letâ€™s collaborate to make data engineering preparation accessible for everyone.
